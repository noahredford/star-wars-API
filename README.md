# star-wars-API

# Description 
I created this API to display the film information for the first 6 Star Wars Films, using SWAPI (Star Wars API). I created this application to showcase my
knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, API's, Fetch Requests, and JSON.

#Usage 
This application can be used for Star Wars fans who want to know the movie title, the opening title (opening crawl), and the movie release date.
